## <i>Give me something, something real</i>

Hi, I'm Alisson and I'm 28 years old, I'm a developer who loves to work with Elixir and LiveView, that's my speciality, but may you can find something more that (I confess, the bar with Rust will start to grow).
I'm that type of person that knows the humanity just survived working together, so it's easily to find me trying to help and trying to make every place i'm in more comfortable, I can recognize that's my signature.

###  Featured Projects: 

#### Digistab Store
An e-commerce platform built from the ground up using Elixir and LiveView. It is special not just because I wrote it from scratch, but because it made a mark on me: overcoming self-doubt and delivering a complete, polished application, oh, and beautiful too! There's a extense roadmap of things that I would like to implement on that, but now I know that it will grow with me. Elixir, LiveView, S3 uploads....

#### Ratobo (ChatGPT-bot)
  That's my son, Ratobo is a telegram bot with support for OpenAI API that doesn't do a usable thing, it's just for fun, so, via Parameter Store, I define allowed groups, allowed users that can talk with him privately, and a custom prompt that makes him exactly who he is, my son. Elixir Phoenix and RabbitMQ with Broadway.

#### alASHandria Library
  My newest project, just to have a little fun with Ash Framework, using ETS tables at the moment, it is burned at every single rise. AshFramework, just it.

###  Current Focus

-  Diving deep into the latest LiveView features and best practices (I started with LiveView in 2020)
-  Exploring new ways to leverage Elixir's concurrency model in real-world applications
-  Taking a look at Rust (to enhance Elixir performance, of course)
-  I think I'm liking Ash Framework more than I expected...
