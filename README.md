## Welcome here, I'm Alisson! 

Today is the day you gonna notice... my profile...

I'm a 28 years old developer who loves to work with Elixir and LiveView, I prefer to make it clear here, just because that's what you'll find on here, as they're the technologies where I truly shine and enjoy building solutions.

While I'm still working on building confidence to contribute to other public repositories (not yet, sorry!), I pour my heart into my personal projects. Each one represents a step in my growth as a developer. As this one that I`ll comment below.

###  Featured Project: Digistab Store

Currently, the project of my heart is the Digistab Store - an e-commerce platform built from the ground up using Elixir and LiveView. It is special not just because I wrote it from scratch, but because it made a mark on me: overcoming self-doubt and delivering a complete, polished application, oh, and beautiful too!
